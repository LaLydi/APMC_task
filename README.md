# iOS recruitment task for APMC
This is a recruitment task for A Parent Media Company. This app retrieves a list of available episodes from a server that can be streamed.

## Tools

Built using **Xcode 16.2** and **SwiftUI 5**. 


## Assumptions and Limitations

- The app assumes that the user has a reliable connection to the internet to populate the episode list and stream the videos.
- The app assumes the user has an up-to-date iOS device.

## Design

When presented with this task, I designed these screens.

For presentation, I designed a simple logo for the app and named it "Play It Safe"

## Architecture

For this app, I went with a **MVVM** architecture.

Some of the reasons for my rationale:
- SwiftUI heavily relies on MVVM architecture. Using @Published properties makes it easier to manage the change of states of the View Model in the View.
- Separation of concerns: by using MVVM, the data's logic and handling are not getting mixed up and are easier to maintain. Although this app is small, I like to think of projects as kids that will eventually grow up, so why not invest some time now and make them maintable for their eventual growth and change?
- For unit testing: I included some simple unit tests where the business logic can be independently tested without involving any other component.


## FAQ

#### Did I face any issues?

Not really. Although I prefer UIKit over SwiftUI, I found this task really easy to manage with this technology. Also, the documentation for SwiftUI is getting better.

#### How long did it take?

This task took me around 3 and a half hours to complete.


## Further development

To build up this task, I would like to:

- Add a thumbnail to the episodes in the episode list.
- Create custom player buttons for the PlayerView.
- Build and design the brand to have a more cohesive design across the app.
